	<h1>Adventure Activities</h1>
	<p> When I have free time, I enjoy activities such as fishing, hiking, camping, mountain biking and being outdoors. 
Some of my favorite locations for actives like these include Baxter State Park, 
Acadia National Park, and other secret locations far up north. 


<p>
Coming from an outdoor active family from Maine, I am always able to listen to myself and find my calm state of 
being when I am in the outdoors.

<p>
Mountain biking is another one of my favorite outdoor activities. Back home, I lived close to a vast trail system where I had access to ride my bike.
Here, at the University of Maine, I have found many great trails in the university forest which I plan to explore even more!
