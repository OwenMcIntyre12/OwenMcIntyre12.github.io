	<h1>Future Hopes and Aspirations</h1>
	<p>Planning for the future is never a bad thing to do. I find that listing my planned future is a good way to set goals for myself. 
	After college, I plan to get a job and start my life in the outside world. Considering the fact that my major is Finance, 
	I plan to focus my job in the business world. Within that job, I would push myself to hold a high position and work with 
	people in an effective way. 
	</p>
	<p> Someday, I plan to have a family and live in a house with them. I am inspired by my parents and I hope to someday live 
	similar to them.
