<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I was born in New Britain, Connecticut, then relocated to a small town in southern Maine at 10 months of age.
 Back home, I live with two younger siblings, my Mother and my Father. Both of My parents graduated from the University of Maine,
creating a solid path to follow. Yet I plan to forge my own path throughout these four years. 
<p>In my hometown, I was a big soccer and hockey player. I played in the youth programs, then moved my way up to the varsity rosters once making it to high school. 
I dont tend to follow many profesional sports teams, however a few that I like include,
<UL>
	<LI>Manchester United</LI>
	<LI>Juventus</LI>
	<LI>Boston Bruins</LI>
	<LI>Boston Red Sox</LI>
</UL>

<B>High School Hockey</B>
<p>
I plan to keep myself active for the rest of my life by continuing to play sports. Weather is be a mens leauge or just playing around with 
some friends, these types of activities keep the physical body and mental health strong.
